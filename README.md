# Space-Invaded
This is my masterpiece in Java.<br>
In this game, the player controls an alien that is trying to protect its planet (mars) from astronalt invaders.<br>
The game has 4 levels, 4 types of enemies, 3 types of guns and a loooooot of chalanges.<br>
When finished, you are able to store you time in a local storage (.txt archive).<br>

Here are a few prints from the game:
